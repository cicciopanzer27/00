# MIAL - Meta-Ignorance AI Language

## Overview

MIAL (Meta-Ignorance AI Language) is an AI-native programming language designed specifically for artificial intelligence systems, symbolic reasoning, and meta-cognitive computing. It builds upon the MIA (Meta-Ignorance Architecture) system to provide native support for uncertainty, confidence, and self-aware computation.

## Language Features

### Core Principles
- **Uncertainty as First-Class Citizen**: Built-in support for probabilistic variables and confidence levels
- **Meta-Reasoning**: Native constructs for reasoning about reasoning
- **Symbolic Computation**: First-class support for mathematical and logical symbols
- **Self-Modification**: Code that can modify itself based on learning
- **Knowledge Representation**: Native support for knowledge graphs and semantic networks

### Syntax Highlights

```mial
// Probabilistic variables with confidence
let temperature: prob(0.7) = 23.5 ± 2.1;
let weather: confident(0.9) = "sunny" | "cloudy" | "rainy";

// Meta-reasoning constructs
meta know(temperature) ? {
    if confidence(temperature) > 0.8 {
        conclude("High confidence in temperature reading");
    } else {
        seek_more_data("temperature_sensors");
    }
}

// Symbolic computation
symbol Q_plasma = P_fusion / P_input;
symbol Lawson_criterion = n * T * τ_E > threshold;

// Self-modifying functions
learn update_knowledge(new_data) {
    if validate(new_data) {
        integrate(new_data);
        self.confidence += 0.1;
    }
}

// Knowledge representation
knowledge_graph fusion_physics {
    Q_plasma -> relates_to -> Lawson_criterion;
    tokamak -> implements -> magnetic_confinement;
    ITER -> exemplifies -> fusion_reactor;
}
```

## Language Specification

### Data Types
- `prob(confidence)` - Probabilistic values with confidence levels
- `confident(level)` - Confidence-weighted values
- `symbol` - Mathematical/logical symbols
- `knowledge_graph` - Semantic networks
- `meta` - Meta-cognitive constructs

### Control Flow
- `meta` - Meta-reasoning blocks
- `learn` - Learning/adaptive functions
- `conclude` - Conclusion statements
- `seek` - Data seeking operations
- `validate` - Validation operations

### Built-in Functions
- `confidence(x)` - Get confidence level
- `uncertainty(x)` - Get uncertainty measure
- `validate(x)` - Validate data/knowledge
- `integrate(x)` - Integrate new knowledge
- `reason_about(x)` - Meta-reasoning function

## Integration with MIA System

MIAL is tightly integrated with the existing MIA system:
- Symbols created in MIAL are automatically added to the MIA roadmap
- Knowledge graphs are visualized in the MIA dashboard
- Meta-reasoning operations are tracked for transparency
- Learning operations update the MIA knowledge base

## Getting Started

1. Install MIAL interpreter: `npm install -g mial`
2. Start REPL: `mial`
3. Load MIA integration: `import mia`
4. Begin coding with AI-native constructs

## Examples
